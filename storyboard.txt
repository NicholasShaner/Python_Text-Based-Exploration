
    In the magnificent world of automotive repair, the battles fought with blood, sweat, and
sometimes even tears, are all in demand of subduing the ultimate villain of the industry, the dreaded
unruly customer. To win this small battle and take one step closer to winning the war, you must
collect all 6 necessary items needed to complete the requested service before meeting the
unruly customer head on. Fresh from your last battle, you start at the Service Counter, from
where you will need to run headstrong to the Service Drive and collect the waiting villains
VEHICLE. Head to the Dispatch Office for the PAPERWORK of requested service repairs. Then
you are off to find the required tools and supplies to complete the repairs. You will get the
FILTER from the Parts Department, OIL from the Fluids Room, TOOLS necessary to complete the
services from the Service Bay, and finally, a large cup of COFFEE from the Break Room to refuel
for the current and future battles that will be fought throughout the day. If all the items are
collected, the service can be completed before meeting the angry and unruly customer in the
Waiting Room. If all the items cannot be found, the service, and the battle, cannot be won.
Facing the villain at this point will result in a failed service and the ultimate blow...
